- ✅ **IDS Systems & Incident Response**
- ✅ Practicing on platforms like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**

Certified with the **Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)** by Altered Security, I’ve developed deep insights into adversarial thinking and red teaming strategies.

## 🧩 Beyond Tech

Outside of the digital realm, I enjoy reading, exploring philosophy, and keeping up with the evolving landscape of security and technology. I'm also a big believer in open-source collaboration and ethical hacking.
